🧠 Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my exercises and projects in the field of Machine Learning.
The main goal is to document my learning journey step by step, test different algorithms, and share the results with others.

📌 In addition to basic algorithms such as KNN, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree, some projects also combine Tkinter (for building simple GUIs) and os (for file and path management) to make the programs more interactive and practical.

✨ If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug reports, feel free to open an issue.
